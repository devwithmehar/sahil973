# Welcome to my Profile
Hey, My name is Sahil Mehar. I am a software developer and always excited to learn new technology. Right now I am leaning AWS where I have already used Cognito for the authorization, S3 bucket for storage and many more services.
In December 2021,I earned my bachelor's degree in Business Information Technologies, where I worked on numerous projects in C#, PHP, and Ruby. I gained a good foundation in information technology over the two-year curriculum, with a concentration on application development, web development, and web security. This curriculum also provides practical, applied training through an industry project.
